Title: Recommendation System using Content-Based Filtering Model

## Abstract:
This project presents the development and assessment of a recommendation system employing content-based filtering. Focused on personalized movie suggestions, it integrates user preferences and movie attributes. Using a dataset comprising user ratings and movie information, the report encompasses exploratory data analysis (EDA), baseline model creation, and the assessment of diverse content-based filtering models. Evaluation is based on root mean squared error (RMSE) metrics to compare the performance of various machine learning algorithms.

## Introduction:
Recommendation systems are pivotal in aiding users to explore relevant content. This project centers on a content-based filtering model for movie recommendations, outlining objectives and methodology.

## Objectives:
1. Conduct EDA for dataset comprehension.
2. Establish a baseline model for comparison.
3. Implement and evaluate content-based filtering models employing diverse machine learning algorithms.
4. Compare model performance to determine the best approach.

## Structure:
  Introduction to the project.
  Methodology and code implementation.
  Results and analysis.
  Discussion of findings and recommendations.
  Conclusion summarizing the report.

  
## Methodology:
The project initiates with data preparation and EDA, exploring user demographics, common genres, and rating trends over time. It establishes a baseline model and delves into content-based filtering models, detailing item representation, user profiles, similarity measures, recommendation generation, and scoring formulas. Different machine learning algorithms like linear regression, Lasso regression, K-nearest neighbors, random forest regression, and support vector regression are implemented, trained, tested, and evaluated using RMSE as the metric.

## Results and Analysis:
Insights from EDA including user demographics and genre distributions are provided. The baseline model yielded an RMSE of 0.982, setting a benchmark for content-based filtering models. Assessment of various models using different algorithms resulted in the Lasso regression model achieving the lowest RMSE of 1.037, outperforming others but not the baseline.

## Discussion:
The Lasso regression model stood out but failed to surpass the baseline, suggesting that limited movie features impacted predictive accuracy. Emphasizing the importance of feature engineering and comprehensive movie attributes, this project highlights avenues for improvement in content-based filtering models.

## Conclusion:
While the Lasso regression model excelled, it didnâ€™t outperform the baseline, indicating the need for richer movie attributes. The project sheds light on challenges in content-based filtering models, suggesting future work to incorporate more features and explore hybrid approaches for enhanced recommendations.
